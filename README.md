# Reinforcement Learning Starcraft Agent Project

Video game inspired by PT Silent Hill with the intent of generating a visual experience with a certain degree of suspense through the manipulation of events within the game, such as: repetition of scenarios, interaction with objects on the stage, random changes of lights, aleatory movement of objects and sound manipulation.

Free assets from the community were used to focus on the development of the code of all the events in game.
